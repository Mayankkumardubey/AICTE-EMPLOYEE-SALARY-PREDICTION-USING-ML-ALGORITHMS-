# AICTE-EMPLOYEE-SALARY-PREDICTION-USING-ML-ALGORITHMS-
This repository contains code files and requirements for executing the codes in a proper manner. This repository contains code which uses different Machine Learning Algorithms to predict the salary for the organisation.
# The dataset is firstly preprocessed by using various techniques such as checking for the null values across the columns using inbuilt python functions,eliminating random redundant data , eliminating the negligible data which don't account for betterment of model,detection of outliers and managing them by setting constraints.
#once done with these make sure its applied to each columnn  wherever required, then apply normalisation.
# Analyse the data for encoding type according to its grouping,here label encoding is used as labelled data is being manipulated, in this the data is converted to a categorical series of number in which the highest number is the maximum number of categories in that particular column.
# Seggregate the input columns and output columns by assigning them each a variable.
# Once done with the encoding and seggregation then perform scaling, its used to scale the data in the range of (0,1).
# Split the data into trainig set and testing set.
# Train the model by compariing the results of various parameters such as recall,f1score,precision,accuracy,support.
# Choose a best model, load it in .pkl extension,once done training it.
# With the use of the pickled model ,deployment can be done using streamlit.
# Direct deployment through streamlit is quite possible but through authtoken system its more secure as it gives us each our own authtoken.
# Once deployed ,test the model by giving various inputs.
